* Welcome to STXLUG Livestream
** 4-20-19

* Topic: Encrypt Data and Communications

** Meeting Notes
*** Intro and News
**** Presenter: Eduardo Robles
**** Ubuntu 19.04 available for download now https://ubuntu.com
  
*** Quick intro to encryption
**** /Encryption/ - ~The process of obscuring information to mameetup-4-20-19/kewp-login.php?loggedout=true it unreadable without special knowledge, key files, or passwords.~
**** Encryption can benefit everyone because it ensures tgat the data you are working with is safe from tampering.

*** Luks Encryption
**** Linux Unified Keys System https://gitlab.com/cryptsetup/cryptsetup/
**** This is a utility that helps encrypt devices in Linux.
**** LUKS can be very useful when you want to encrypt whole devices like a external hard drive or usb drive.
*** LUKS Tutorial
** Tutorial
*** Original tutorial found at https://averagelinuxuser.com/encrypt-hard-drive-in-linux/
*** INSTALLING LUKS ON UBUNTU
**** Install LUKS
***** ~sudo apt install cryptsetup~
**** List Partitions
***** ~lsblk~

*** BEGIN CREATING ENCRYPTED PARTITION
**** Encrypt the desired partition
***** ~sudo cryptsetup --verbose --verify-passphrase luksFormat /dev/sdbX~
***** /where X is the number of partition, unless there only a single partition/
***** You will be prompted to enter a password. Make sure it's a strong and memorable one!!
**** Open the encrypted partition
***** ~sudo cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sdbX sdbX~
**** Create a filesystem on encrypted partition
***** ~sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/sdbX~
**** Fine your ext4 partition (optional)
***** ~sudo tune2fs -m 0 /dev/mapper/sdbX~

*** TESTING THE ENCRYPTED PARTITION
**** Create a directory in the partition
***** ~sudo mkdir /mnt/secure~
**** Now mount the partition
***** ~sudo mount /dev/mapper/sdbX /mnt/secure~
**** Now create a test file
***** ~sudo touch /mnt/encrypted/test.txt~
**** Change permissions so regular user can have access to partition (Optional)
***** ~sudo chown -R `whoami`:users /mnt/secure~
**** Test file permission on partition
***** ~touch /mnt/secure/test2.txt~
***** /If the above command worked then you have the correct permission for your regular user, if not then check the previous command and try again./

*** FINISH TESTING AND UNMOUNT PARTITION
**** Unmount partition
***** ~sudo umount /dev/mapper/sdbX~
**** Close encrypted partition
***** ~sudo cryptsetup luksClose sdbX~

** Continued
*** GPG Encryption
**** GnuPrivacyGuard is a tool that uses key-pair system to encrypt data.
**** This is a great tool that is good for encrypting single files or messages.

*** Keybase
**** Keybase is platform that emphasizes privacy and security
**** Keybase offers encrypted communication, files sync, and online repudiation.

*** Signal
**** Signal aims to provide an encrypted messaging platform.
**** Signal is a great replacement for messaging apps such as Facebook Messenger or Whatsapp

*** Wire
**** Wire is a messaging platform that looks to secure 1:1 or group messaging with encryption

*** Tresorit
**** Tresorit is secure and encrypted Dropboox replacement.

** Final thoughts
*** I have showed how you can encrypt data on a drive and other tools that help with encrypted communications. It's always a good idea to learn some of these skills so you can protect your data.

* Thanks!
