<li>We need to stop stereotyping the "evil hackers" as a bunch "dudes in their mom's basements" staring at computer screens.</li>
<li>Most hackers start their careers at a very young <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/dec/08/average-age-of-cyber-attack-suspects-drops-to-17">age</a> (avg. age is 15).</li>
<li>And you do NOT need a college degree to learn the skills to take down a business network. All you need is Youtube.</li>

</ul>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
To practice engineering you need a degree and for some kinds of work an engineering license. But to hack a company all you need is the internet, where you can find all kinds of videos, forums, and manuals that show you all about hacking.

<h4 id="orgda75f57">The dreaded "Windows update broke something"</h4>
<p>
I see this often, Windows decides to update and it breaks your computer or deletes a project file. Well if you have a backup you can breathe a bit easier. When you get your computer working again you can continue working from the backups.

<h4 id="org4be1ed2">Upgrading between program versions</h4>
<p>
When moving between versions of AutoCAD for example, a 2018 AutoCAD file may not open or work in the AutoCAD 2019. But having a backup can spare you a lot of headaches if you decided downgrade back to 2018.

<h4 id="org5e4dad5">Project file hand-off becomes corrupted or lost</h4>
<p>
You are assigned to work on a project and when you complete your portion you hand it off to the next engineer. The hand off doesn't go smoothly and the file ends up corrupted. But you have a backup of your work just before the hand off, so you can simply resend it.
Or say your coworkers computer is no longer working and they lost all their work. Well they can at least pick up from your backup from the hand off.

<h4 id="org1a7ed2e">The LinkedIn hack demonstrates why you should NOT reuse passwords.</h4>
<p>
Imagine if you used the same password for your personal/work email as you did for LinkedIn. Hackers would theoretically have access to both your LinkedIn and your email.

<ul>
<li>Password managers are great and I recommend everyone start using one.</li>
<li>They function like a safe for all your passwords.</li>
<li>They can generate strong random passwords for you and even check if your password has been exposed in security breach.</li>
<li>Just be sure to give your password manager a strong password.</li>

<h4 id="org1f9bc0b">But what about the passwords I need to use on a daily basis?</h4>
<p>
Use a passphrase for those occasions

<section id="slide-org5cf20c7">
<h4 id="org5cf20c7">Passphrases can be just as effective as random passwords.</h4>
<ul>
<li>Be sure to only use that passphrase once per service/site.</li>
<li>And make slight alterations to it, for example a lot of people use Bible verses, but hackers already know that. So change them up a bit, like switch letters for numbers or combine several verses into one.</li>
