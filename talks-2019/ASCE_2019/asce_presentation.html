<h4 id="orgafd0459">We are more connected today than we have ever been before.</h4>
<ul>
<li>Our jobs require us to use computer systems on a daily basis.</li>
<li>So we have to take extra steps to ensure that our work is safe from cyberattacks.</li>

</ul>
</section>
<section id="slide-orgc8a527f">
<h4 id="orgc8a527f">What's the cost to engineering professionals?</h4>
<ul>
<li>As engineers you often work on projects that deal directly with the general public.</li>
<li>Falling victim to cyberattack can have a negative effect on public safety.</li>

</ul>
</section>
<section id="slide-org2e5f1e3">
<h4 id="org2e5f1e3">Cyberattacks cost billions in damages every year</h4>

<li>Nowadays opening the wrong email can take down the entire company network.</li>
<li>Are you able to continue to work if your entire company network is down?</li>

<p>
So we have to seriously consider the impacts that a cyberattack can have. But to do so we have to learn more about the people behind these cyberattacks

<h4 id="orgc1a7896">Continued</h4>
<ul>
<li>We need to stop stereotyping the "evil hackers" as a bunch "dudes in their mom's basements" staring at computer screens.</li>
<li>Most hackers start their careers at a very young <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/dec/08/average-age-of-cyber-attack-suspects-drops-to-17">age</a> (avg. age is 15).</li>
<li>And you do NOT need a college degree to learn the skills to take down a business network.</li>
<li><b>All you need is Youtube</b>.</li>

</ul>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
To practice engineering you need a degree and for some kinds of work an engineering license. But to hack a company all you need is the internet, where you can find all kinds of videos, forums, and manuals that show you all about hacking.

<h4 id="org4c25d8a">Upgrading between program versions</h4>
<p>
When moving between versions of AutoCAD for example, a 2018 AutoCAD file may not open or work in the AutoCAD 2019. But having a backup can spare you a lot of headaches if you decided downgrade back to 2018.

<h4 id="org833c072">Project file hand-off becomes corrupted or lost</h4>
<p>
You are assigned to work on a project and when you complete your portion you hand it off to the next engineer. The hand off doesn't go smoothly and the file ends up corrupted. Or say your coworkers computer is no longer working and they lost all their work. With a backup you can resend the file and work can continue.

Imagine if you used the same password for your personal/work email as you did for LinkedIn. Hackers would theoretically have access to both your LinkedIn and your email.

Password recommendations: Bitwarden, Onepassword. See blog post.

<ul>
<li>Password managers are great and I recommend everyone start using one.</li>
<li>They function like a safe for all your passwords.</li>
<li>They can generate strong random passwords for you and even check if your password has been exposed in security breach.</li>
<li>Just be sure to give your password manager a strong password.</li>

<h4 id="org7b63dd2">But what about the passwords I need to use on a daily basis?</h4>
<p>
Use a passphrase for those occasions.

</section>
<section id="slide-org7854ebd">
<h4 id="org7854ebd">Passphrases can be just as effective as random passwords.</h4>
<ul>
<li>Be sure to only use that passphrase once per service/site.</li>
<li>And make slight alterations to it, for example a lot of people use Bible verses, but hackers already know that. So change them up a bit, like switch letters for numbers or combine several verses into one.</li>
